Type-casting and Hinting Exercises

Please read the note carefully and try to solve the problem below:

"""


"""
1. Type Hinting
    a. create a variable <odd> with hinting as `int` and assign a value to it.
    b. create a variable <PI> with hinting as `float` and assign 3.1415 to it.

    c. create any variable with `string` type hinting and assign `integer` value to it.
        - Check whether the program gives error in execution or not.
        - If it gives or does not give error, then why it gives or does not give error?
"""

# Answer 1a
ood: int = 3

# Answer 1b
pi: float = 3.14
print(pi)

# Answer 1c

any: str = 4
print(any)

import math
def add_int(x, y):
    
    return( math.floor(x) + y)

#No error but do not know why. 
"""
2. Type Conversion
"""
# ----------------------------------------[ a ]-----------------------------------------------

import math
PI = 3.1415
def add_int(PI):
    return( math.floor(PI))

# I want to print the value of PI to be 3. How should I convert the data to an integer


# ----------------------------------------[ b ]-----------------------------------------------

# str_1 = "20"
# str_2 = "30"

# print(str_1 + str_2)
# above line gives us output of "2030" but I want the answer to be 50.
# How would you solve the problem using type conversion?


# ----------------------------------------[ c ]-----------------------------------------------
x = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
sum = 0
"""
- I want the value of sum to be 15.
- The way I get 15 is by adding all items from the list `x`.

Hint: the addition may involve
- for loops in the list
- type conversion
"""


# ----------------------------------------[ d ]-----------------------------------------------
odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
prime = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
"""
use type conversion to these lists to appropriate data type and find out
    - numbers that are odd but not prime
    - numbers that are either odd or prime
    - numbers that are prime but not odd.

Final values should be converted into list again and stored to variables.
