Tuple Exercises

Please read the note carefully and try to solve the problem below:

"""

"""
1. Write a program to create a tuple to  add 5 different numbers.
    a. find out the length of the tuple
    b. find out the 3rd element of the tuple by accessing it through the index
    c. use `enumerate()` function to map each element with its index and print it using the foreach loop
        - please see the reference to the file 02_data_types/06_tuples.py

"""
# answer 1

tuple_practice = ("Sunday", "is", 44, 22, "fun")
print(tuple_practice)
print(type(tuple_practice))
# a

# b
print(tuple_practice[2])


# c
for j, element in enumerate(tuple_practice):
    print(j, element) 


"""
2. Write a program to create a nested tuple and access different elements of the inner tuple using
   positive and negative index positions.


"""

nested_tuple = ([2, 4, 6],
                ["sam", "Sara", "Dan"],
                (33, "Fork", 34, "Thai"),
                ["we", "got", "this"],
            )
print(nested_tuple)
print(nested_tuple[2] [2])
print(nested_tuple[-1] [-2])


"""
Bonus:
3. create two different tuples t1 and t2 with different elements inside it
    a. create the next tuple t3 to add all values of t1 and t2 using the destructuring method

    - suppose t1 has (1,6,9,4,3)
    - and t2 has (2,7,8,3,5)
    -t3 must have (1,6,9,4,3,2,7,8,3,5)
    - make sure to use destructuring method using `*` operator in the tuples
"""

t1 = (88, "Say", "well", 44)
t2 = ("same", "way", 24, "go")

#a
t3 = (3, 9, 8)
# t3 = [t1, t2]
t4 = [*t1, *t2, *t3]
print(t4)
